### Exercise 2: Roll a die

You are hosting a D&D gaming night for your friends. Everything is ready and set,
but suddenly you discover that a D8 dice is missing, and you can't find it
anywhere.

You decide to apply your software engineering skills and simulate such a dice on
a web page. Perhaps a big number rendered in center of the page, with a "Roll"
button underneath would do the job?

#### Hints

* You will need a source of randomness for this task. [Math.random()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random)
is available out of the box.
